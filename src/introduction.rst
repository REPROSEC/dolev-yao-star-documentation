Introduction
=============

This is a hands-on introduction to DY* as taught in a practical course for computer science students.

We will use small example protocols to learn how to model a protocol in DY*
and how to state and prove security properties.
We assume knowledge of F* and refer to the `F* Tutorial <https://fstar-lang.org/tutorial/>`_ for an introduction.

In this chapter, we introduce the example protocols, and explain some of the main concepts of DY* on a high-level before going in to more details in the following chapters.

If you are already familiar with the Dolev-Yao symbolic model of protocols and trace based security properties,
you may directly skip to :ref:`sec-modelling` after the example protocols.
